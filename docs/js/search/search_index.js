          This directive is the main interface to dynamic animations.\nIt should be attached to the element that is to be animated.\nDirections\nIn a component define a string member to represent the state\nof the Animations.  This is analogous to a trigger in normal\nAngular animations.\nThen define the animations as an array of state and transition\nfunction calls from the Angular animations module.\nOptionally specify a map of state names to css class names that\nwill be added and removed from the element as the animations \nstart and finish.\nThen pass those values into this directives state and animations\nInputs.\nIf a :leave animation, or *=>void, is speciied you must also both\nadd the @dvkLeave directive to the element and add dvkLeave to \nthe component as a static animation.  This step is only necessary\nfor a :leave animation. Otherwise it can be skipped.\nThe animations can then be played by changing the string bound to\nthe state Input.\nExample\n`ts\n\\@Component({\n              template: `\n                  \n\n

This directive is the main interface to dynamic animations.\n * It should be attached to the element that is to be animated.\n * \n * ## Directions\n *\n * In a component define a string member to represent the state\n * of the Animations.  This is analogous to a trigger in normal\n * Angular animations.\n * \n * Then define the animations as an array of state and transition\n * function calls from the Angular animations module.\n * \n * Optionally specify a map of state names to css class names that\n * will be added and removed from the element as the animations \n * start and finish.\n * \n * Then pass those values into this directives state and animations\n * Inputs.\n *\n * If a :leave animation, or *=>void, is speciied you must also both\n * add the @dvkLeave directive to the element and add dvkLeave to \n * the component as a static animation.  This step is only necessary\n * for a :leave animation. Otherwise it can be skipped.\n * \n * The animations can then be played by changing the string bound to\n * the state Input.\n * \n * ## Example\n * \n * ```ts\n * \\@Component({\n *              template: `\n *                  \n *              `\n *              animations:[dvkLeave]\n * })\n * ```\n * class MyComponent {\n *              myState: string = 'closed';\n *              myAniamtions = [\n *                  state('open',style({\n *                      'transform': `scaleY(1.0)`,\n *                      'transform-origin': 'top'\n *                  })),\n *                  state('closed',style({\n *                      'transform': `scaleY(0.0)`,\n *                      'transform-origin': 'top'\n *                  })),\n *                  transition('openclosed',animate('200ms')),\n *                  transition(':enter',animate('200ms',\n *                      style({ 'background-color': 'green' })),\n *                  transition(':leave',animate('200ms',\n *                      style({ 'background-color': 'red' }))\n *              ]\n *              myCssMap = {\n *                  'open': 'is-open',\n *                  'closed': 'is-closed'\n *              }\n * \n *              toggleState() {\n *                  if(this.myState === 'closed') { \n *                      this.myState = 'open'; \n *                   }\n *                   else { \n *                       this.myState = 'closed'; \n *                   }\n *              }\n * }\n * ```\n * \n * ../../docs/examples/index.html#/DynamicAnimations\n */\n@Directive({\n  selector: '[dvk-da]'\n})\nexport class DynamicAnimationsDirective implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\n\n  /**\n   * @ignore\n   */\n  private stateMode: 'string' | 'number' = 'string';\n\n  /**\n   * @ignore\n   */\n  private animationsHandler: DynamicAnimationsHandler;\n\n  /**\n   * @ignore\n   */\n  private strState: string;\n\n  /**\n   * Changing the value of state will cause a transition \n   * and play an animation if one is defined for that state\n   * change.\n   */\n  @Input() set state(state:string) { // | number)\n    this.strState = state;\n\n    if(this.animationsHandler) {\n      this.animationsHandler.nextState(this.strState);\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @ignore\n   */\n  private transitions: AnimationTransitionMetadata[];\n\n  /**\n   * @ignore\n   */\n  private states: AnimationStateMetadata[];\n\n  /**\n   * The description of the animations to play as an array \n   * of state and transition Angular animation functions.\n   */\n  @Input() set animations(animations: (AnimationTransitionMetadata | AnimationStateMetadata)[]) {\n    this.transitions = [];\n    this.states = [];\n\n    animations.forEach(animation=>{\n      if(this.isTransition(animation)) {\n        this.transitions.push(animation);\n      } else if (this.isState) {\n        this.states.push(animation);\n      }\n    });\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @ignore\n   */\n  private isTransition(metaData: AnimationMetadata): metaData is AnimationTransitionMetadata {\n    return !!(metaData as AnimationTransitionMetadata).animation;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @ignore\n   */\n  private isState(metaData: AnimationMetadata): metaData is AnimationStateMetadata {\n    return !!(metaData as AnimationStateMetadata).styles;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * The map of state name to css class names to apply\n   * as the state changes.\n   */\n  @Input() cssMap: StateCSSMap;\n\n  constructor(\n    private element: ElementRef,\n    private daService: DynamicAnimationsService,\n    private tranService: NgTransitionService,\n    private statesService: NgStateService,\n    @Optional() \n    private dvkLeave: LeaveDirective) {\n      if (this.dvkLeave) {\n        this.dvkLeave.setLeaveTiming(\"500ms\");\n      }\n     }\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n\n    this.animationsHandler = this.daService.createAnimationsHandler(\n      this.element.nativeElement,\n      NgTransitionStates.Void,\n      this.tranService.buildAnimationTransitions(this.transitions),\n      this.statesService.parseStates(this.states),\n      this.cssMap);\n      \n    // enter\n    this.animationsHandler.nextState(this.strState);\n  }\n\n  ngOnDestroy() {\n\n    // leave\n    this.animationsHandler.nextState(NgTransitionStates.Void)\n  }\n}\n\n    \n\n    \n            \n                Your browser does not support iframes.\n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"interfaces/DynamicAnimationsHandler.html":{"url":"interfaces/DynamicAnimationsHandler.html","title":"interface -

specified by\n * the model and handle change detection in the same way the \n * async pipe does.\n *  \n * ### **Directions**\n * \n * Provide a {@link DynamicComponentSerializerService} \n * for the directive to use.\n * \n * ```ts\n * constructor(private dsService: DynamicComponentSerializerService) { \n *     this.serializer = this.dsService.createSerializer({\n *         'textComponent':TextComponent\n *     });\n * }\n * ```\n * \n * And define a {@link DynamicComponentModel} for the DynamicComponentDirective\n * to initialize with:\n * \n * ```ts\n * text$ = new Subject();\n * \n * onClick = (e: MouseEvent) => {\n *     console.log('Dynamic component was clicked');\n * }\n * \n * model: DynamicComponentModel = {\n *     name: 'textComponent',\n *     initialValues:{ \n *         text: 'Initial Text',\n *     },\n *     outputCallbacks: {\n *         onClicked: this.onClick\n *     },\n *     inputs$: {\n *         text: this.text$.asObservable()\n *     }\n * };\n * ```\n * \n * And in the template for the Component attach the dynamic \n * component directive to the desired element.\n * \n * ```html\n *  \n *  \n * ``` \n * \n * ###### **Note**\n * \n * The {@link DynamicComponentSerializer} was intentionally made\n * to be passed in rather than created internally so that the same\n * serialzer could be reused for multiple instances of the \n * DynamicComponentDirective.  This allows a developer to create \n * a single serializer at one point and feed it into all desired \n * instances of DynamicComponentDirectives.\n * \n *

ViewContainerRefs referenced with\nstring name values.\nCreating Containers\nContainers can be defined inside a Component template with the \nContentContainerDirective\nor a custom directive that extends ContentContainerDirective.\n\nThe string names provided to the directive can be used to reference\nthat container through an instance of ContentConductor.\nCreating Content\nContent is supplied through either the ContentDirective or a custom directive that extends it.  This is a structural directive so when used it must be prefixed with a * like *ngIf or *ngFor.\nThe ContentDirective takes an input which represents the string name of the ContentContainerDirective to initially attach the view to.\n  dynamicContents = [];\n  dContainerName = 'one';\n\n  addContentToAlternatingContainer() {\n    this.dynamicContents.push(0);\n    this.dContainerName = this.dContainerName === 'one'? 'two':'one';\n  }\n  Conductor Content 1\n  Conductor Content 2\n  \n    New Content\n  \nNote\nStructural directive inputs are bindings.  So the value given to the directive must either be a bound variable, *dvk-content=\"containerName\", or an anyonmous string variable, *dvk-content=\"'one'\".  Providing a bare string, *dvk-content=\"one\" will result in the template attempting to bind to the component controller member one.\nExtending ContentDirective\nThe ContentDirective can also be extended in order to provide preset initial container names or other functionality.\n@Directive({\n  selector: '[one-content]'\n})\nexport class OneContentDirective extends ContentDirective {\n  readonly initialContainerName = 'one';\n\n  constructor(private tRef: TemplateRef) { super(tRef) }\n}@Directive({\n  selector: '[two-content]'\n})\nexport class TwoContentDirective extends ContentDirective {\n  readonly initialContainerName = 'two';\n\n  constructor(private tRef: TemplateRef) { super(tRef); }\n}  oneContents = [];\n  twoContents = [];\n\n  addToOne() {\n    this.oneContents.push(0);\n  }\n\n  addToTwo() {\n    this.twoContents.push(0);\n  }  \n  \n    One Content\n  \n  \n    Two Content\n  \nCreating a Conductor\nThe ContentConductor can be created by injecting the ContentConductorService into a component's constructor.\n  constructor(private ccService: ContentConductorService) { }And then calling the createContentConductor method with the QueryLists for the ContentContainerDirectives and the ContentDirectives or their derivatives.  Generally, these QueryLists should be available during a components' ngAfterViewInit lifecycle method.\nThe init method starts listening to the QueryLists for changes.\n  @ContentChildren(ContentDirective,{ descendants: true }) \n  contents: QueryList>;\n\n  @ViewChildren(ContentContainerDirective)\n  containers: QueryList;\n\n  conductor: ContentConductor;\n\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\n    this.conductor = this.ccService\n      .createContentConductor(this.containers, this.contents);\n\n    this.conductor.init('one');\n  }Or provide multiple ContentDirectives or ContentContainerDirectives.\n  @ContentChildren(ContentDirective,{ descendants: true }) \n  contents: QueryList;\n\n  @ContentChildren(OneContentDirective,{ descendants: true }) \n  oneContents: QueryList;\n\n  @ContentChildren(TwoContentDirective,{ descendants: true }) \n  twoContents: QueryList;\n\n\n  @ViewChildren(ContentContainerDirective)\n  containers: QueryList;\n\n  conductor: ContentConductor;\n\n  constructor(\n    private ccService: ContentConductorService) { }\n\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\n    this.conductor = this.ccService\n      .createContentConductor(\n        [this.containers], \n        [this.contents,this.oneContents,this.twoContents]);\n\n    this.conductor.init();\n  }Using the Conductor\nThen content can be moved from one container to another by specifying\nthe container string names.\nthis.conductor.moveViews('one','two');The ContentConductor also provides the ability to move single views from one container to another based on their index inside the container.\nthis.conductor.moveView('one','two',3);Detach a single view from any container returning the ViewRef.\nconst vRef: ViewRef = this.conductor.detachView('one',2);Attach a view to the end of a specified container.\nthis.conductor.attachView('two',vRef);Detach all views from a specified container.\nconst views: ViewRef[] = this.conductor.detachViews('one');And attach an array of views to a specified container.\nthis.conductor.attachViews('two',views);Finally the content conductor should be destroyed inside the components\nngOnDestroy method in order to free up the resources it uses.\nngOnDestroy() {\n  this.conductor.destroy();\n}Note\nAll of the methods that insert views into containers also have an optional index parameter at the end that is the index to insert at.\nIf it is not specified the items are inserted to the end of the containers views.\nContent\nContent is added to the containers by creating it inside the element that has containers in it's view and creates the conductor.

These animations are supplied at run time instead of statically in the Component decorator so a component developer can expose the animations specification and a consumer of the component can supply their own animations.\nDefining a set of Animations\nAnimations are defined using the same functions that normal Angular animations use with a few exceptions.  The animations are defined as an array containing state and transition definitions from @angular/animations.  A trigger definition is not recognized as the DynamicAnimationsDirective supplies an @Input member state that works in the same way as a trigger does.\nOther constraints are that no part of an animation can refer to a defined trigger, such as some forms of query, and no part can refer to a specific state.  The concept of states is implemented fully by the AnimationStateMachine as the Angular AnimationBuilder does not have the same concept of states as the standard static Angular animations.\nA simple animation looks like this.\nanimations = [\n    state('open',style({\n        'transform': `scaleY(1.0)`,\n        'transform-origin': 'top'\n    })),\n    state('closed',style({\n        'transform': `scaleY(0.0)`,\n        'transform-origin': 'top'\n    })),\n    transition('openclosed',animate('200ms'))\n];Currently supported abilities include the wild card for transitions like *=>open or closed=>* as well as :enter.  The :leave state has limited support at the moment.  Please refer to the section below.\nNote\nMore complex animations as defined normally by Angular are supported but have not all been fully tested at this time.  If you find any animations that work statically but do not work dynamically outside of the constraints listed above please submit a bug report with the animation that does not work included.\nAnimation States\nThe state itself can be represented by a string member that can be bound to the state @Input of the directive.  \ncurrentState = 'closed';The animation directive will automatically transition from the void state to the value of the bound state during initalization.  It will play any :enter or *=>void transitions that match the conditions as were definined in the animations.\nNote\nCurrently only string states are supported; numerical values will not work and neither will :increment or :decrement transition styles.  Support is planned but not yet implemented.\nUsing the DynamicAnimationsDirective\nThe dynamic animations directive can be attached to an element and passed the animations and the state binding.\n\nTransitioning the State\nThe state can be transitioned simply by changing the value of the bound member to the next desired state.\nthis.currentState = 'open';The transition that matches the change in state with the most specificity will be played when the value of the bound state is changed.\nLeave Transition\nThe leave transition is partially supported at the moment.\nIf a :leave animation, or *=>void, is specified you must also both\nadd the @dvkLeave directive to the element and add dvkLeave to \nthe component as a static animation.  This step is only necessary\nfor the leave animation. \nThis is due to the fact that Angular will remove an element before a dynamic animation has a chance to play.  A static leave animation must be used to keep the element around long enough for the dynamic animation to actually play.\nCurrently the dvkLeave directive is set to a constant time of 500ms.  In the future this value will be made dynamic to match the dynamic animation supplied.\nSo in order to use a leave animation first attach the animation to the component metadata.\n@Component({\n    animations: [dvkLeave]\n})Then add it as a trigger to the element containing the DynamicAnimationsDirective.\n\nAnd define a leave transition inside the animations supplied to the directive.\ntransition(':leave',animate('200ms',\n    style({ 'background-color': 'red' }))\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/dynamic-animations/example.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/dynamic-animations/example.html","title":"additional-page - Example","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Your browser does not support iframes.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/dynamic-components.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/dynamic-components.html","title":"additional-page - Dynamic Components","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Components\nThe Dynamic Components module provides a directive that will instantiate components dynamically with the ability to hook up their inputs to observable streams and provide callbacks for the instantiated components output emitters.\nCreating a Serializer\nA DynamicComponentSerializer is used to translate between a string name and a Component class instance.  This allows the string name to be stored inside an ngrx store, transmitted to a server, or any other use that might be desired and the data can be used later to instantiate the same dynamic component.  \nA serializer can be created with the createSerializer method of the DynamicComponentSerializerService.  \nFirst inject the service into a components constructor.\nconstructor(private dcsService :DynamicComponentSerializerService) {} And then pass the createSerializer method a DynamicComponentsMap of string names to component class instances.\nserializer: DynamicComponentSerializer;\n\nngOnInit() {\n    this.serializer = this.dcsService.createSerializer({\n        'textComponent': TextComponent,\n        'numberComponent': NumberComponent\n    });\n}This serializer is stateless other than the map and can be reused for any number of instances of DynamicComponentDirectives.\nCreating a DynamicComponentModel\nA DynamicComponentModel is the model that the DynamicComponentDirective uses to instantiate a component and hook up any streams specified.\nA DynamicComponentModel extends the DynamicComponentData interface.  The DynamicComponentData interface was designed to be serializable so it can be stored or transferred as desired.  It consists of a name string and an initialValues object.  The name is the serialized name of the component that should be instantiated.  The initializedValues should be a map of fields inside the component class type to the desired initial values for those fields.  As long as the field values are serializable this entire data structure can be safely stored and used for any purpose.\n@Component({\n    template: `\n        \n        {{text}}\n        \n    `\n})\nclass TextComponent {\n    @Input() text: string;\n    @Output() textClicked = new EventEmitter();\n}\n\nconst data: DynamicComponentData = {\n    name: 'textComponent',\n    initialValues: {\n        'text': 'The initial text for this component'\n    }\n}This data structure can be combined with the other fields of the DynamicComponentModel before it is applied to the directive.\ntext$ = new Subject();\n\nonClick = (e: MouseEvent) => {\n    console.log('Dynamic component was clicked');\n}\n\nconst model: DynamicComponentModel = {\n    ...this.data,\n    inputs$: {\n        text: this.text$.asObservable()\n    },\n    outputCallbacks: {\n        textClicked: this.onClick\n    },\n    providers: [\n    /* Any custom providers for the component can be supplied here */\n    ]\n}Note\nThe context of this inside callbacks will be the dynamic component and not the class where the callback is defined unless the callback method is defined as an arrow function or the value of this is bound before passing the result to the dynamic component.  This example uses an arrow function to preserve the context of this inside the onClick callback.\nCreating a DynamicComponentDirective\nWith the model set up and a serializer created those two pieces can now be passed off to an instance of the DynamicComponentDirectives inside the template of a component.\n\nThe DynamicComponentDirective will use the serializer to resolve the string name to a component and create an instance of it.  It will apply any specified initial values during instantiation.  Then it will hook up any specified input streams and output callbacks to the members of the component.\nThe directive will track and properly dispose of the subscriptions for the streams and will trigger change detection manually when new values are emited from the input streams.  The input streams also have a distinct until changed operator applied.  The directive should manage these streams in the same way that the async pipe does for other components.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/dynamic-components/example.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/dynamic-components/example.html","title":"additional-page - Example","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Your browser does not support iframes.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
